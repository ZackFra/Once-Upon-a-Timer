# Timer App

This app was built as an example for [this](https://hakt.tech/blog/2024-08-22) blog post. It was created to demonstrate how complicated creating a client-side timer can get.

The front-end is located in the client folder. It's build in React with Next.js and uses a few UI dependencies.

The back-end is written in Go and is located in the server folder. It exists primarily to pipe requests to a SQLite database.
